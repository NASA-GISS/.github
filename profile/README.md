# About GISS

The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is a laboratory in the <a href="http://earthsciences.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Earth Sciences Division</a> (ESD) of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a>'s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/goddard/">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> (GSFC). The ESD is part of GSFC's <a href="http://sciences.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Sciences and Exploration Directorate</a>.

Since 2004, the GISS series of coupled atmosphere-ocean models use a framework called <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/">ModelE</a>, which provides the ability to simulate many different configurations of Earth System Models â€” including interactive atmospheric chemistry, aerosols, carbon cycle and other tracers, as well as the standard atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface components. As the model has developed, we have used different version numbers to denote progress, as documented below.
